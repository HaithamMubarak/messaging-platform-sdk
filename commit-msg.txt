feat(web-sdk): simplify connection modal and remove auto-connect

Major UX improvements to connection modal:

Connection Modal Changes:
- Initially collapsed when shared/saved link detected (PC & mobile)
- Same compact layout on all screen sizes
- Dark overlay shown even when collapsed
- Separate rows: title+toggle, username input, connect button
- Blue info note: 'Saved or shared channel - Enter your name to connect'

Auto-Connect Disabled:
- Removed auto-connect timer (3-second countdown)
- Removed cancel auto-connect logic
- Users MUST click Connect button manually
- Simplified code by ~150 lines

Readonly Fields Removed:
- Channel name and password now fully editable
- Removed readonly attributes from 4 locations:
  * AgentInteractionBase.js
  * common-utils.js
  * share-modal.js
  * whiteboard-client.js
- Disabled readonly styling functions
- Warning note shown when editing shared link credentials

Files Modified:
- connection-modal.js: Restructured HTML, added notes, simplified logic
- connection-modal.css: Same layout all screens, keep overlay when collapsed
- common-utils.js: Disabled auto-connect, removed readonly
- AgentInteractionBase.js: Removed auto-connect calls, removed readonly
- share-modal.js: Disabled readonly highlight functions
- whiteboard-client.js: Removed readonly from shared link handler

Benefits:
- Consistent UX across all devices
- Users have explicit control over connection
- All fields editable (with warnings)
- Cleaner, simpler codebase
- No confusing auto-connect behavior

Breaking: None (backward compatible)
