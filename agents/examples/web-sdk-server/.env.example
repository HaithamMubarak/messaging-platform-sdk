# Messaging Platform Configuration
#
# This file is optional. The application will automatically search for .env in:
# 1. Current project root
# 2. Sibling messaging-platform-services repo (if available)
# 3. Falls back to system properties/environment variables
# 4. Uses built-in defaults (limited functionality)
#
# If you're contributing to the open-source SDK and need to test locally,
# copy this file to .env and configure your values.

# Messaging Service API Key (REQUIRED for full functionality)
# Get this from your messaging platform dashboard or use the services repo configuration
# Without a valid API key, the application will use a demo key with limited access
MESSAGING_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Messaging Service URL (optional - defaults to production)
# For local development with services repo running:
# MESSAGING_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1/messaging-service
#
# For production (default):
MESSAGING_SERVICE_URL=https://hmdevonline.com/messaging-platform/api/v1/messaging-service
